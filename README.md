### Introduction
This is some worth-reading documents about git and GitLab, if you're not familiar with the tool, I recommend you to read them first.

For non-technical people, SourceTree is highly recommended because it is fast, robust and intuitive.

### Folder structure
There are three main folders:
- Documentation
- Raw Assets: 3D Artists store their work _within_ this folder.
- UnityProject: The Unity project folder itself.

### Contact
